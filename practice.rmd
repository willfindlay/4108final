# Basic Concepts and Principles

# Cryptographic Building Blocks

# User Authentication

# Authentication Protocols and Key Establishment

# Operating Systems Security and Access Control

# Software Security -- Privilege and Escalation

## Race Conditions

- TOCTOU
    - time of check to time of use
    - setuid has owner's privileges, but we need to make sure real user can access the file
    - `access` system call traditionally used
    - but an attacker can attempt to change the file between checking access and opening it for writing
    - this allows us to access another file that we shouldn't
- how to stop this?
    - atomic privilege checks would be nice
        - not portable
    - drop privileges and then fork before opening the file, make descriptor available to parent before exiting
        - also not portable
    - use system calls that deal directly with file descriptors
        - also not portable
    - no perfect solution, application dependent
- other notes
    - niceness can tip the balance in the attacker's favor
    - make checking process much higher niceness (slower) -> larger window to win the race

## Integer-Based Vulnerabilities and C Issues

- problems:
    - signedness
    - overflow
    - underflow

### Problems with C

- favor efficiency/direct access over security
    - it lets us make mistakes like the ones above without warning
- undefined behavior -> machine-dependent results
    - signed integers have undefined behavior, unsigned integers use modular wrapping
- pointer arithmetic
- accessing memory using overflow/underflow values
- using overflow/underflow values for branching conditions
- pointer arithmetic changes based on size of type
- types can have different sizes based on architecture

#### Why We Can't Just Fix This

- some developers rely on the behavior we described above (intentional overflows)
    - introducing runtime errors breaks backwards compatibility
- warning about possible errors is not necessarily possible
- safe integer libraries are a good option, but how do we enforce adoption?

## Stack-Based Buffer Overflows

- too many bytes written to stack may overflow into adjacent memory
- natural vs intentional
    - natural yields unexpected outcomes
    - intentional results in security issues

### Memory Layout

- text and global data segments are lowest, initialized at start
- heap is low, grows up
- stack is high, grows down

### How it Works

- on function call, new args are pushed onto stack
- current instruction pointer is pushed as return address
- now we push local vars onto stack and execute the function
- overflowing a local var overwrites higher memory
    - if we overwrite return address, we can point it elsewhere, including into our overwritten memory

## Heap-Based Buffer Overflows

- dynamic allocation is less predictable, varies between systems
- attacker has to experiment to find a vulnerable variable
    - there needs to be a useful higher memory address that is exploitable
- this is also only useful if memory corruption does not crash the program

### Heap Spraying

- inject code many, many times into various locations in the heap
- then use an independent exploit to trigger code execution
- you only need to get it right once

## Three Main Steps for Buffer Overflows

1. Code injection
    - inject code into an area of memory
1. Corruption of control flow
    - change control flow to go to that code
1. Seizure of control
    - run that code

## Buffer Overflow Exploit Defenses

- make head and stack non-executable
- stack canaries
    - key words that detect code injection
    - if the key word is overwritten, raise an error
- run-time bounds checking
- ASLR, random heap allocators
    - randomize memory layout
    - disrupts attacks that rely on known memory locations
- type-safe languages
- safe C libraries
- static analysis tools
    - analyze code and flag potential problems

## Privilege Escalation

- move from fixed functionality to a command shell
- escape a sandbox
- gain root privileges
- move from root privileges to kernel privileges (e.g., install a rootkit kernel module)
